# PhotoLocator
## Photo geotagging and location browsing
PhotoLocator can import GPS tags from GPX files and EXIF data from other JPEG files and apply to photos that were not geotagged.

## Why PhotoLocator?
I have been using GeoSetter for many years but it has not been maintained for a long time and then it completely stopped working 
for me. Since I was unable to find a suitable replacement I decided to make a new geotagging application and make it open source.

## Source code
PhotoLocator is written in C# targeting .net6.0 for Windows.
