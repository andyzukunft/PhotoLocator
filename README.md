# PhotoLocator
## Photo geotagging and location browsing
PhotoLocator can import GPS tags from GPX and KML files and EXIF data from other JPEG files and apply to photos that were not geotagged.

## Slideshow with location map
There is also a full screen slideshow feature with a small location map display. You can drag/drop in files and folders to do a 
slideshow across multiple folders. 

Note that it is possible to use Chrome's full screen cast feature to display the slideshow on a TV with Chromecast.

## Why PhotoLocator?
I have been using GeoSetter for many years but it has not been maintained for a long time and then it completely stopped working 
for me. Since I was unable to find a suitable replacement I decided to make a new geotagging application and make it open source.
